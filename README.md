Programs based on  Lowest Common Ancestor(LCA) algorithm and enhancing solution the implementation to word with grapgs in directed acyclic form (DAGS).My main focus for these was to f0cus on the retsing of the code by creating JUNIT tests for possible error cases to make sure all scenarios are handled sufficiently. For LCA I sourced code from GEEKS4GEEKS and for DAG my solution is based off of Sedgewick and Wayne's Digraph java class

# master branch contains LCA folder containing:

-LowestCommonAncestor.java file with code for LCA program

-LowestCommonAncestorTest.java file with tests for LCA program

-LCA_DAG.java file with DAG program

-DAGTest.java file with tests for DAG program





# DAG branch contains LCA folder containing:

-Older version of LowestCommonAncestorTest.java and LowestCommonAncestor.java files

-Most up to date version of LCA_DAG.java and DAGTest.java
